## Overview

CottonProphet leverages data science and machine learning to analyze historical data related to cotton production and predict future yields. By understanding trends and influencing factors, this project aims to assist in improving agricultural practices and optimizing production outcomes.

## Objectives

- To predict cotton yield based on historical data and various influencing factors.
- To analyze the impact of different variables (such as weather conditions, soil quality, and crop management practices) on cotton production.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to visualize predictions and insights.

## Data Sources

The project uses multiple datasets including:

- **Weather Data:** Historical weather conditions including temperature, rainfall, and humidity.
- **Soil Data:** Information on soil quality, nutrients, and pH levels.
- **Crop Management Data:** Data on planting, irrigation, and fertilization practices.
- **Historical Yield Data:** Past cotton production records to train predictive models.

## Methodology

The project employs the following methodology:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gathering and cleaning data from various sources to ensure quality and consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Identifying key features that influence cotton production and creating new features where necessary.
3. **Model Development:** Building and testing various machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forests, neural networks) to predict cotton yields.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
5. **Deployment:** Implementing the best-performing model and integrating it into a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast future cotton yields based on historical data and machine learning models.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs to help users understand trends and predictions.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate different models to determine the most accurate predictor.

## Installation

To run CottonProphet on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedLike/CottonProphet.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd CottonProphet
   ```
3. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can run the predictive models and explore the data by following these steps:

1. **Run the prediction script:**
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```
2. **View the results:** The script will output predictions and save them in a specified file or display them via the console.
3. **Explore the visualizations:** Use the provided notebooks or scripts to generate and view data visualizations.
